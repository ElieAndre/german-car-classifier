# 🚗 German Car Classifier 🇩🇪

Welcome to the German Car Classifier repository! This project features an advanced machine learning model designed to distinguish between four of Germany's most iconic car brands: **BMW**, **Mercedes**, **Audi**, and **Porsche**. Developed using FastAI, this classifier delivers fast and accurate predictions, making it an excellent tool for car enthusiasts and developers alike.

## 🌟 Features

- **Identify German Cars:** Quickly and accurately classify images of BMW, Mercedes, Audi, and Porsche vehicles.
- **Interactive Web App:** Run the classifier locally or experience a live demo on Gradio.
- **Model Training:** Delve into the Jupyter notebook that contains the model training process, including data preprocessing and evaluation.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **app.py:** The primary script to launch the classifier locally using Gradio.
- **germancarclassifier.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook detailing the model training process, from data collection to evaluation.
- **bmw.jpg, mercedes.jpg, audi.jpg, vw.jpg, porsche.jpg** Sample images included for testing the model's accuracy.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/german-car-classifier.git
    cd german-car-classifier
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:7860` to interact with the German Car Classifier.

### Live Demo

For those who prefer not to set up the project locally, you can try the German Car Classifier online via Gradio. [Click here to view the live demo!](#)

## 📸 Example Images

Included in the repository are several `.jpg` files. These are example images you can use to test the performance of the model. Simply upload an image through the web app to see the classifier in action!

## 📓 Model Training

The model was meticulously trained using the `germancarclassifier.ipynb` notebook. This notebook walks you through the data preprocessing steps, model selection, training, and evaluation. Feel free to explore and modify the notebook to experiment with the model.
